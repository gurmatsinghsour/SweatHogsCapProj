# CapstoneProject

## Overview
This project is structured into two main parts:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Run the notebook in the `dataPreprocessing/` folder first to clean and prepare the data.

2. **Modeling**  
   Once preprocessing is done, proceed with model building and evaluation inside the `Models/` directory under either `deepLearning/` or `machineLearning/`.

## Notes
- Ensure paths are correct when accessing files across folders.
- Preprocessing must be completed before running any model notebooks.
